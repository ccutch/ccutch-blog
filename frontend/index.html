        <h2>First implementation goal: Notebooks</h2>
        <p>
            I find that often i am struck with an idea which i would like to explore,
            share and keep track of -- such as this website. But find it hard to track my
            ideas in a meaningful way that I can revisit and share with friends without
            pouring too much effort into an idea that may never pan out or that i lose interest
            in. For this problem I would like to make a simple notebook application.
        </p>
        <p>
            This application should be easy to use, secure so other people can use it and
            automated to help make your ideas more understandable to others and iterable.
            For this reason it is imperative that these notebooks can:
            <ul>
                <li>Self summarize as you write.</li>
                <li>Track sources you link in your writing.</li>
                <li>Are versionable with older revisions being accessible.</li>
                <li>And sharable though simple urls and printable styleguides.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
